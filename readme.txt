Display USGS topographical maps on your site with a simple shortcode that is placed in a page or a post.

== Description ==

AutoTopo allows you to display USGS topographical maps on your site with a simple shortcode that is placed in a page or a post.  You need to know the latitude and longitude of the area that you want to display.  With that information, simply input the lat, long into the "autotopo" shortcode and you're good to go.  

== Screenshots ==

1. The options page for AutoTopo features two simple options, plus an example of the shortcode used to display maps on your pages and posts

2. Here's an example of a hiking site using AutoTopo to show a map of a mountainous hiking region.

You have likely typed in your latitude and longitude incorrectly or have specified a location outside of the USA.  Double check that first.
